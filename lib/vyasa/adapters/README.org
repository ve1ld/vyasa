* Purpose
Adapters are modules that align to the [[https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter]["Adapter" structural pattern]].
It's not necessary that they must interface to an external service or anything.

Currently only Binding module satisfies this and it's because it serves as a glue between different structs.
