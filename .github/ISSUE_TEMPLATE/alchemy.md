### Present Context

<details>
<summary>Helping words...</summary>

Where we collectively investigate and interrogate the problem space and iteratively scope our approach.

Breakdown to landmarks that communicate shared context we are working towards through 2-tiered task list, CRUD list elements as development unfolds.

Strike the scope of code that reveals the most about the problem/solution FIRST not necessarily the easiest or hardest parts
```
- [ ] Parent Task
    - [ ]  Child Task
    - [ ]  Child Task
  
- [ ] Parent Task
    - [ ]  Child Task
    - [ ]  Child Task

```

Introduce us to the problem space. Write out what you already know about the terrain you are the recce commander enriching us with details beyond the fog of war.

Where have you tried applying and encountered difficulties?

How have others attempted to scale or explore these challenges? 

(Embed internal & external links to related or possible  paths of exploration, stackoverflow, documentation, github etc)

Who should be notified?

### Reflection

<details>
<summary> Helping words...</summary>
Where the eternal wheel returns back to practice and what we finally implemented is to be outlined. You are the historian or archivist bringing clarity to future-yous and us about your foray.

Emphasis on approaching timeless solutions for well-defined problem space through distillation by decanting that which is un-needed and abstracting that which is essential to approaching the problem space. 

Add any reflections and internal links to future potential and blindsides.
