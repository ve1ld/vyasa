*Two Brothers.*

On a mission to build a bridge


> When I was a King and a Mason - a Master proven and skilled <br>
I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build. <br>
I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently under the silt <br>
I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.
