> [!NOTE]
> This project is early in its development. Feature roll-outs follow the pace of what some of our partners and user-groups require.
> Please watch this repo on GitHub and follow [the blog](https://blog.vyasa.tv" "Vyasa Blog") for development updates.


Indic philosophy has always had a rich oral tradition, passed down across generations through word of mouth in the form of fables and hymns — inspiring people both in and out of the diaspora.

This project provides a digital medium for people to learn, share and engage in meaningful discourse around the topic of Indic philosophy.

</pre>



#### Features 

<pre>
TODO closer to soft launch for initial test users
